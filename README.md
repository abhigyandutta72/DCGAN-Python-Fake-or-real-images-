# DCGAN-Python-Fake-or-real-images-
A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by Radford et. al. in the paper Unsupervised Representation Learning With Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
